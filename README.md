Zimbra::Expect
==============

For commandline administration of Zimbra the tools zmprov and zmmailbox
are very handy. They have one BIG disadvantage though, they take ages to
start. Some think the commands themselves are slow, but this is not the
case. Once they are up and running they are reasonably fast.

With this package you can start zmprov or zmmailbox once and then
communicate with them from a Perl script.

To get you started, have a look at the sample application in the
examples directory.
