Zimbra::Expect
==============

For commandline administration of zimbra it the tools zmprov and zmmailbox
are very handy. They have one BIG disadvantage though. They take ages to
start. Some think the commands them selves are slow, but this is not the
case, once they are up and running they are reasonable fast.

With this package you can start zmprov or zmmailbox once and then
communicate with it from a perl script.

To get you started, you have a lookt at the sample application in the
examples directory.


Enjoy
